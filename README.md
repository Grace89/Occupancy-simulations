Description

DataS1.R â€“ Code used to simulate and analyze data to determine the optimal number of surveys and sites when surveying species rich communities. 

First part- creates function to simulate the data.

Second part- defines model in BUGS language

Third part- define parameters to monitor and the values to run the functions

Fourth part- create empty matrices to store recovered parameters

Fifth part- loop used to run the set of parameters and store recovered parameters
